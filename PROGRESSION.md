### My Progression On Sensor

The sensor uses 9V-27V for power and connects via ethernet. I powered up the sensor with a switching mode power supply and connected to a Linux machine.

The machine did not recognise the ethernet connection to be connected so I set the IP address manually which completed the connection.
